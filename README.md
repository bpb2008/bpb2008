# Welcome! 👋🏾

Hi, I'm **Brittany Thompson**, a software developer with a passion for building responsive, user-centered web applications. Since January 2023, I’ve been immersed in modern full-stack development with a focus on the **PERN stack** (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React/TypeScript, and Node.js). I'm also starting to become a fan of Next.js! 

## Current Projects

- **🐾 [Baby Kitty Rescue Website Redesign](https://babykittyrescue.vercel.app/)**  
  Rebuilding a nonprofit's website using React/TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite to improve performance, mobile responsiveness, and maintainability.

- **✅ [Habitude](https://habitude-tracker.vercel.app/)**  
  A full-stack habit tracking app in development with a cross-functional team. Built with Next.js, PostgreSQL, and NextAuth.js, featuring user authentication, habit streaks, and community sharing options.

- **🌍 [JourneyWise](https://journeywise.netlify.app)**  
  Built in collaboration with my Cherry On Tech Spring 2024 team. A responsive, accessibility-first travel planning app designed for inclusivity and usability.

## I’m Open to New Opportunities

If you're looking for a junior software developer or apprentice who brings not only technical skills but also a strong background in law and business management, I’d love to connect.
