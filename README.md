### Welcome! 👋🏾

Hi, I'm Brittany and I'm an aspiring software engineer! I started teaching myself how to code in January 2023, and I'm currently learning PERN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js) full stack development.  
 
- 🌱 I’ve just completed [JourneyWise](https://journeywise.netlify.app/), with my Venus Voyagers squad in Cherry on Tech's Spring 2024 Cohort.
- 🔭 I am currently working on [DisDash](https://github.com/bpb2008/DisDash), a full-stack app where users can manage their plans for their Disney vacations. 
- 👯 I’m open to joining your company! Do you need a junior software engineer or an intern? I would be delighted to work for you. For further information about my experience and my contact information, check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittanythompson08/). 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Prior to January 2023, I had no experience in tech. I graduated from law school with a JD in 2016 and have a BA in Sociology. I've spent the past 8 years as an entrepreneur, co-owning a window coverings and flooring franchise in Houston, TX. This is a huge pivot into software engineering, but I am excited to see what my unconventional perspective can bring to the tech industry!
